\page pmc Propulsion System

This package includes two components revolving around Astrobee's propulsion system:

* FAM (Force Allocation Module)--- Converts force and torque commands to nozzle opening angles
* PMC simulator--- simulates the robot's propusion system. It is essentially the reverse of the
  FAM--- given impeller commands and servo commands, it returns the force and torque applied to the robot.
